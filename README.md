# SGS

[GUTILS](https://github.com/SECOORA/GUTILS) configuration files for the [SECOORA](http://secoora.org) Glider System (SGS). This repository can be updated at any point and changes will be reflected in any new files or products produced by the SGS (including netCDF files uploaded to the IOOS Glider DAC). The SGS checks for updated configuration files in this repository just before checking for any new data from the gliders.
