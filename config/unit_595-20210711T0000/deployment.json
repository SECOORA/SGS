        "comment": "Shipboard observations of marine mammal distribution and habitat are expensive and logistically challenging to collect in Arctic waters.  Port facilities are minimal and access to appropriate vessels for spending extended periods of time at sea is extremely limited.  Autonomous platforms like gliders provide the capability to collect both oceanographic and passive acoustic data for far longer periods of time (weeks to months) and at significantly reduced costs than traditional shipboard or aerial surveys.  We have developed a system to record, detect, classify, and remotely report Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammal calls in real time from Slocum ocean gliders based on the digital acoustic monitoring (DMON) instrument and the low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS).",
