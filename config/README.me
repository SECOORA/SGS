# SGS Deployment Configurations

To create a new deployment, copy the `template__YYYYMMDD` folder to a new folder. The name of the new folder is arbritrary and is only used to separate the configurations for each deployment. They are not used when processing the data. Use a unique folder name for each deployment and assign the `glider` and `trajectory_date` values inside of the `deployment.json` file correctly. Together, these two attributes make up the "deployment id" that is used to identify the unique glider deployment.
