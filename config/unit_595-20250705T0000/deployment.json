        "acknowledgement": "The Teledyne Webb Research Slocum underwater glider used in this study was expertly prepared by the University of Alaska (UAF) College of Fisheries and Ocean Science (CFOS) underwater glider operations team. This deployment was made possible by Rebecca Woodgate (University of Washington), chief scientist of the deployment cruise on the R/V Norseman II. At sea assistance was provided by the captain and crew of the R/V Norseman II. Support for the development of the Arctic marine mammal call library as well as the preparation and operation of the glider in 2025 was provided by the Alaska Ocean Observing System. The glider was procured in 2016 with support from the North Pacific Research Board.",

This dataset was collected as part of the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) Glider Observatory funded by AOOS, the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The purpose of the AOOS Glider Observatory is to support ecosystem assessments and fishery management, help detect marine heatwaves, to monitor the strength of algal blooms and to study the occurrence of several species of marine mammals, including fin, bowhead, and beluga whales, as well as bearded seals and walrus. This project is designed to examine relationships between marine mammal distribution and oceanographic conditions monitored by the glider.",
